# aer — Agent Execution Runtime

[![CI](https://github.com/aer-runtime/aer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aer-runtime/aer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Cross-language process execution and lifecycle supervision runtime with deterministic cleanup semantics.

---

## The problem

Standard process APIs (`subprocess`, `.NET Process`, `std::process`) cannot reliably manage process lifecycles under failure conditions. When a spawned process creates children of its own, those children frequently outlive the parent after cancellation or timeout — leaving orphan processes that hold ports, lock files, and burn CPU with no owner.

## What AER does

AER is a Rust core library that guarantees consistent process lifecycle behavior across platforms:

- **Deterministic events** — every execution emits `Started` then `Exited`, in that order, always
- **No silent failures** — spawn errors are typed and explicit; no swallowed results
- **Platform-agnostic contract** — Windows and Linux behave identically from the caller's perspective
- **Future: no orphans** — process tree cleanup (M3) will ensure nothing survives final termination

---

## Quickstart

Requires [pixi](https://pixi.sh). The Rust toolchain is managed automatically — nothing else to install.

```sh
# Run the hello example — spawns a process and prints lifecycle events
pixi run example

# Run all tests
pixi run test

# Lint and format check
pixi run lint
pixi run fmt-check
```

### Example output

```
Spawning task...

  → Started  (pid 12345)
  → Exited   (code 0)

Done.
```

Dependencies flow inward only. No process logic lives in the bindings.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Status | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| **M1: Core Scaffold** | ✅ Complete | State machine, STARTED/EXITED events, single-shot execution |
| **M2: Timeout & Kill** | Planned | Configurable timeout, graceful termination, kill escalation |
| **M3: Process Tree** | Planned | Job Objects (Windows), setsid (Unix) — no orphans guaranteed |
| **M4: FFI Boundary** | Planned | Stable C-compatible ABI for language bindings |
| **M5: .NET Binding** | Planned | P/Invoke wrapper, `IAsyncEnumerable<Event>` |
| **M6: Python Binding** | Planned | ctypes/cffi wrapper, asyncio context manager |
